# Instagram HTML5 video control

Simple script that detect 
on every scroll all new video loaded on the feed,
remove the old media control _(play button, fullscreen button, volume button, well... media buttons in short)_
and add better controls provided from HTML5

Need to be injected with some extension
on the browser, using "instagram.com" as domain

You can import it from
